The title of this web page is "art-template". 

## 2. PROJECT DESCRIPTION
2. PROJECT DESCRIPTION
This is a template for an art exhibition in webpages for artists.
I was trying to emulate a template and make an exact replica of the template without any additions and creativity.
Figuring out exactly what I should do to achieve it was challenging as at the time I was making it. I would like to completely remake it in the future and maybe make it such that the webpage would not just be servicing an artist but many.
