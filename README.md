## Artist Bio
Hi, I'm Aura, a designer, architect and a painter with a passion for creating unique and thought-provoking pieces. My art is inspired by  nature, technology, human emotions, and I aim to evoke wonder and curiosity, contemplation in those who experience my work.

With a background in creative art, I've honed my skills in painting to bring my creative vision to life and I'm constantly exploring new ways to push boundaries and challenge myself.

This collection on GitHub showcases a selection of my artistic works. I hope you enjoy exploring my art, and I welcome any feedback or collaborations!
